description: Sending off my Cannondale CaadX in the best way possible
---
This is a love letter to my first cyclocross bike, a 2018 Cannondale CaadX 105 I named Marnie.

I got this bike in 2018 as bike number 3 in my nascent love for the sport. I wanted to get a bike that could handle racing cyclocross, which I heard was fun (understatement of the year), but could also help me run errands around town better than an old 2007 Specialized Hardrock MTB or my used 2010 Trek Madone road bike. Obviously, the CaadX was not the right decision; it doesn’t have any rack mounts on the frame, and I ended up finding a different bike for city riding & errands. But I was able to race cross with it!

My first race, I had some red aluminum flat pedals on it, not clipless pedals. This was prudent, as there was a sand section that I had to hop off and run through, and remounting was a lot easier without fiddling with clipping in like some other racers. I had no clue what I was doing, as evidenced by a buddy warning me that the leaders were going to lap me soon, and my response was simply “Fuck you, you’re about to get lapped too!”

For later races, though, I switched to clipless SPDs, and picked up a used power meter as well. It wasn’t the best season, but I noticed a ton of improvement throughout the season as the cat 5 field whittled down due to colder & worse conditions, and my technical skills got better. Still, half the fun was just hanging out with my buddies after the races, drinking & heckling the later races.

In 2020, the pandemic killed off the entire racing season; while there were a few cross races that happened, as there were later season road races, they were all predicated on showing up for your race and then going right home, no spectating allowed. I skipped.

When I totalled my road bike, a Trek Madone, in the end of August 2020 after crashing it on a mountain descent, the CaadX was the only bike I could ride, and I did ride a ton of miles until I finally built a replacement road bike (an Allez Sprint Disc).

I got a second wheelset in 2021 & started doing gravel rides more regularly with the CaadX, expanding my horizon to some seriously steep & gnarly mountain gravel roads west of Boulder. Gravel was fun, and I even managed to race Steamboat Gravel Red (that’s a story for another day). Still, I was hoping that cross would return to at least partial strength.

In the fall, I swapped the bike over to a 1x setup with a Wolftooth direct drive chainring I had been sitting on since I ordered it in 2020. No more dropped chains, hopefully… except all along the issue with dropped chains wasn’t so much the front chainring & derailleur but the lack of clutch on the 105 RD. Oops.

USAC rules had mandatory cat 5 AKA Novice upgrade after 10 races, and I was sitting at 9 so I manually catted up so I didn’t have to switch mid-season. 4s were definitely more challenging than the 5s, but also I managed to keep a similar %ile as I was in the 5s in 2019. More importantly, I broke its sticker virginity and quickly after had it covered in stickers.

I upgraded my gravel wheel cassette to a huge dinner plate, 11-42T, and combo’d it with a Wolftooth Roadlink (Wolftooth rocks) for 2022. Summer was a lot of road racing, with less gravel than 2019, but the extra gearing was definitely needed for the gravel roads & race (Robidoux Rendezvous) I did.

I did have one incredibly scary moment descending down from a mountain town on a long loose dirt descent on my CaadX. At one point someone gave me a heads up my back wheel didn’t look straight. Turns out the disc + QR combo managed to work itself loose a bit on the descent. The wheel was still on, but not 100% seated correctly. Absolutely terrifying, and probably the real impetus for me replacing it with a thru axle bike.

Sad to say, 2022 CX will be the last season on this bike. As much as I love it, I think it’s likely going to be sold (how many bikes does one man need? n+1, sure but 2 cross bikes feels excessive?). Hopefully it ends up going to someone just starting on their own cross journey.
